For running the code sample example is given below:
1)gcc -o s server.c -pthread
2)./s
then take a new terminal and do the following:
3)gcc -o a client.c -pthread
4)./a A
here A is just the name for the client (you can choose any according to your wish)
OPen a new terminal and type
5)gcc -o b client.c -pthread
4)./b B

You can type message in any client terminal and you can see the output

Working
--------
Client is sending the data to all other client in the network. For that client first send the data to server , and server will send the data to the corresponding client.

write(sock,client_name,strlen(client_name))Â  to send the msg to server
(fgets(msg,500,stdin)>0): eg we will write "hi" then hi is stored in msg and this msg is being send to server through write function.
In the same program a single client is able to send msg to sever using write and receive msg from server using recv because of multithreading.
client use pthread_create to create a thread that receive msg from server. and the main client will write /send msg to server.
